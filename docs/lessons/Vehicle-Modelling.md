# Vehicle Modelling Capstone

## Read this after
Read [Load Transfer and Normal Loads](Load-Transfer-and-Normal-Loads.md) and [Braking Dynamics and Deceleration Budget](Braking-Dynamics-and-Deceleration-Budget.md) first.

## Goal
Explain how the local corner, acceleration, and braking constraints become one final speed profile and lap time.

## What you will learn
- What each pass does
- How the final speed is chosen
- Why the black line can look lower than every colored line
- Where to check the code and tests

## High-level overview of the sim
At each sampled track point, the solver asks three questions.

1. Pass 1 asks what corner equilibrium allows at this point
2. Pass 2 asks what acceleration can reach from the previous point
3. Pass 3 asks what braking must allow for the next points

The final speed takes the lowest allowed value.

$$
v_{final,i} = \min\left(v_{pass1,i},\ v_{pass2,i},\ v_{pass3,i}\right)
$$

If you only remember one rule, remember this one.
The final speed is always the most restrictive limit at each sampled point.

Implementation truth in code

- Pass 1 is applied as a corner cap inside Pass 2 and Pass 3
- The stored final profile is then computed as $\min(v_{pass2}, v_{pass3})$ point by point

Think of Pass 1 as a ceiling.
Then Pass 2 and Pass 3 push upward from each side.
The lower surface becomes the final lap profile.

## The sim visually

Script path [tools/analysis/generate_vehicle_modelling_capstone_figures.py](../../tools/analysis/generate_vehicle_modelling_capstone_figures.py)

Inputs

- Track = datasets/tracks/FSUK.txt
- Model variant = b1
- Solver flow = Pass 1 corner ceiling, Pass 2 forward accel, Pass 3 backward brake

Results

- Final profile in code is the min of Pass 2 and Pass 3 after both are corner capped by Pass 1
- Example taken from the last segment in a representative FSUK run

## Worked example
This point shows why backward braking limits matter.
The selected segment is near-straight in curvature but must still satisfy upcoming braking needs.

In a representative FSUK run, Pass 1 at a low-curvature segment returns a speed well above the mechanical limits.
Pass 2 (forward acceleration) reaches a moderate speed based on the power available.
Pass 3 (backward braking) is lower still because a tight corner is ahead.

The final speed follows Pass 3.

$$
v_{final} = \min(v_{pass1},\ v_{pass2},\ v_{pass3}) = v_{pass3}
$$

Equivalent implementation form

$$
v_{final} = \min(v_{pass2},\ v_{pass3}) = v_{pass3}
$$

That is the key behavior of the three pass method.

## Why the black line can look lower than every pass

The solver computes speed at discrete sampled points.
At each sampled point, the final speed is an exact minimum.
There is no hidden post filter in the combine step.

$$
v_{final,i} = \min(v_{pass2,i}, v_{pass3,i})
$$

Pass 1 is already applied inside Pass 2 and Pass 3 through corner caps, so the final combine takes the min of those two constrained profiles.

The visual effect appears between points when the active limiter switches.

A limiter is the rule that currently sets the lowest allowed speed.
A limiter handoff means that this rule changes from one pass to another between nearby points.

Example from this run around one segment pair

- At point i, Pass 2 = 24.78 and Pass 3 = 35.84 so final picks 24.78
- At point i+1, Pass 2 = 28.50 and Pass 3 = 22.85 so final picks 22.85

On the chart, each curve is drawn by joining sampled points with straight lines.
During a handoff, the black line joins one point limited by Pass 2 to the next point limited by Pass 3.
That joined black segment can sit below both colored segments near the middle, even though each sampled point is still an exact pointwise minimum.

So when black appears below all colored lines locally, that is a line-joining artifact from limiter handoff between adjacent sample points. It is not an extra realism filter.

This joined line is only a plotting choice.
The solver limits are enforced at the sampled points.
Lap time integration also uses these sampled node speeds.

## What happens near the start and end points

Forward and backward passes start from different ends of the point list.
Forward starts at point 0 with `speeds[0] = point_speeds[0]`.
Backward starts at the last point with `speeds[-1] = point_speeds[-1]`.

Because of this, the active limiter near the boundaries can change with track and setup.
There is no fixed rule that backward must be lower at the end.

In a representative FSUK run, the last segment is forward limited.
Pass 2 is lower than Pass 3 at that point, so the final speed follows Pass 2.

The pass loops run along the listed points only.
They do not add an extra wraparound segment from last point back to first point inside these loops.

## Deeper dive in each pass

### Pass 1 corner limit
Pass 1 solves each point for the highest feasible corner speed.
It uses lateral and yaw equilibrium with tyre limits.

Core relation

$$
a_y = v^2\kappa

- [src/simulator/util/vehicleDynamics.py](../../src/simulator/util/vehicleDynamics.py) function `find_vehicle_state_at_point`

### Pass 2 forward acceleration limit
Pass 2 walks from start to end.
It applies powertrain request, tyre limits, and drag.

Core relations

$$
F_{x,net} = \min\!\left(F_{x,power},\ F_{x,tyre\_cap} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{F_{y,demand}}{F_{y,cap}}\right)^2}\right) - F_{drag}
$$

$$
v_{pass2,i} = \min\left(v_{pass1,i},\ \sqrt{v_{pass2,i-1}^2 + 2a_x\Delta s}\right)
$$

Code path

- [src/simulator/util/calcSpeedProfile.py](../../src/simulator/util/calcSpeedProfile.py) function `forward_pass`

### Pass 3 backward braking limit
Pass 3 walks from end to start.
It enforces braking feasibility for upcoming segments.

Core relation

$$
v_{pass3,i} = \min\left(v_{pass1,i},\ \sqrt{v_{pass3,i+1}^2 + 2a_{brake}\Delta s}\right)
$$

Code path

- [src/simulator/util/calcSpeedProfile.py](../../src/simulator/util/calcSpeedProfile.py) function `backward_pass`

### Final combine and lap time
The final speed profile takes the minimum of forward and backward constrained profiles.

Code path

- [src/simulator/simulator.py](../../src/simulator/simulator.py) function `run_lap_time_simulation`

## How the code runs step by step

1. Build track and vehicle models
2. Run Pass 1 for point wise corner ceilings
3. Run Pass 2 for forward acceleration propagation
4. Run Pass 3 for backward braking propagation
5. Combine profiles and integrate lap time

## Assumptions and limits
- Quasi static segment level model
- Steady state corner solve at each point
- If corner equilibrium solve fails at a point, a constrained fallback speed is used and logged
- No full suspension transient states in this solver
- No full tyre thermal transient states in this solver
