# Powertrain Model and Wheel Force Flow

## Audience
This note is for developers who need to understand how the simulator turns RPM and gearing into longitudinal force.

## Goal
Explain the first-principles powertrain chain used in this repository, how wheel radius enters the equations, and how powertrain force is combined with tyre limits in lap simulation.

## Starting Point
The production path uses

- lookup-table power data for the power unit
- drivetrain ratios and efficiency from vehicle parameters
- wheel-radius conversion from torque to force

Current default configuration uses Honda CBR600RR power data in [config.json](../../config.json).

## First Principles View
At the wheel hub, power and torque are related by

$$
P = T \omega
$$

At the contact patch, longitudinal force from wheel torque is

$$
F_{x,traction} = \frac{T_{wheel}}{r_w}
$$

So a larger wheel radius reduces traction force for the same wheel torque.

## Runtime Model in This Repository

### 1) Power curve lookup
Powertrain data is loaded by [src/vehicle/Powertrain/basePowertrain.py](../../src/vehicle/Powertrain/basePowertrain.py).

- If available, it uses `Continuous Power [kW]`
- Otherwise it falls back to `Peak Power [kW]`

Default data file

- [datasets/vehicle/PU_data/Honda_CBR_600RR_RPM_vs_Peak_Power.csv](../../datasets/vehicle/PU_data/Honda_CBR_600RR_RPM_vs_Peak_Power.csv)

### 2) Torque from power
The model computes torque from lookup power as

$$
T_{engine}(rpm) = \frac{P(rpm) \cdot 1000 \cdot 60}{2\pi \cdot rpm}
$$

This is implemented in `LookupTablePowertrainModel.get_torque`.

### 3) Speed to engine RPM
Vehicle speed is mapped to engine RPM in [src/vehicle/vehicle.py](../../src/vehicle/vehicle.py)

$$
rpm = \frac{v \cdot 60 \cdot (g_i \cdot g_f)}{2\pi r_w}
$$

Where

- $g_i$ is selected gear ratio
- $g_f$ is final drive ratio
- $r_w$ is wheel radius

### 4) Wheel torque through drivetrain
Wheel torque is

$$
T_{wheel} = T_{engine} \cdot g_i \cdot g_f \cdot \eta_{tr}
$$

Where $\eta_{tr}$ is transmission efficiency.

### 5) Traction force at contact patch
Powertrain-limited traction force is

$$
F_{x,power} = \frac{T_{wheel}}{r_w}
$$

## Where wheel_radius matters
`wheel_radius` is active in two places.

1. RPM mapping
A larger radius reduces RPM at a fixed vehicle speed.

2. Torque-to-force conversion
A larger radius reduces contact-patch force for the same wheel torque.

This is why `wheel_radius` has direct monotonic contracts in [tests/test_parameter_enforcement_contracts.py](../../tests/test_parameter_enforcement_contracts.py).

## Gear Selection Logic
At each speed step, the solver tries all configured gear ratios and selects the one with maximum net longitudinal force.

Entry point

- `Vehicle.select_optimal_gear` in [src/vehicle/vehicle.py](../../src/vehicle/vehicle.py)

## Coupling with Tyre Model and base_mu
The forward pass in [src/simulator/util/calcSpeedProfile.py](../../src/simulator/util/calcSpeedProfile.py) uses

1. Powertrain-limited force from wheel torque and wheel radius
2. Tyre-limited longitudinal cap from tyre model
3. Combined-slip budget reduction under lateral demand
4. Aerodynamic drag subtraction

Implemented net step

$$
F_{x,net} = \min(F_{x,power}, F_{x,tyre\_limit}) - F_{drag}
$$

`base_mu` primarily acts on tyre force capability, not on engine torque generation.
So `base_mu` belongs in tyre explanation, while `wheel_radius` belongs in powertrain explanation.
Both must be cross-linked because acceleration depends on both.

## Validation and Contracts
Relevant direct checks

- [tests/test_parameter_enforcement_contracts.py](../../tests/test_parameter_enforcement_contracts.py)

Covered monotonic relationships include

- higher `transmission_efficiency` gives higher wheel torque
- higher `final_drive_ratio` gives higher wheel torque
- larger `wheel_radius` gives lower traction force
- higher `gear_ratio` gives higher wheel torque at fixed RPM

## Known Limits
Current powertrain model is compact and quasi-static.
It does not currently model

- clutch dynamics and shift transients
- traction control actuation
- engine inertia and transient torque dynamics
- thermal derating and fuel constraints

This tradeoff keeps runtime fast and stable for sweep-heavy lap studies.
